# Paladin Desktop

Paladin Desktop is an open source distributed social networking client, built to promote privacy and data portability. Users create and control their own social profile, keeping the original copy of it on their machine and sharing it only under their terms.

Status updates and biographical information can be pushed to any number of public or private Paladin servers, you can even run your own. If you don't like how a public server administrator runs their server, be it through unethical privacy practices or censorship, abandoning ship is just a matter of choosing a different server, because with Paladin, users have full control and ownership of their data.

## Status
